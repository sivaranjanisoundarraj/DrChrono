# Description of ignored messages:
# * I:                              Notice that pylint ignored something
# * C:                              Convention/Style
# * bad-builtin:                    Use of builtins like map, filter, etc., rather than a list comprehension
# * attribute-defined-outside-init: Attributes should be defined on the class or within __init__
# * fixme:                          "TODO", "FIXME", "XXX" comments
# * star-args:                      *args, **kwargs
# * no-member:                      Access to unknown attribute. Django does too much magic for this
# * no-init:                        No __init__ method on class. Django models don't need one
